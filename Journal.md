I opened ldjam.com and checked the theme. I decided that I am not participating this time.

I woke up early and changed my mind. I will participate in Ludumdare 50 and spend 3 hours making `base code` that it's not related to the gameplay. :')

The idea for the game is to play as a seed that bury very very deep underground. It has to sprout before the time runs out. The player has to avoid obstacle and collect energy until reach the surface.

I have rough ideas for the ending and small secret hiding in the game.

I have finished core gameplay for player control and avoiding mechanic.

I have finished the game flow. The player can start from the `Title` scene and play until reaching the `Ending` scene. The game needs a lot of polish and add more assets.
